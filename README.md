# Resnet18 from Scratch
Alhamdulillah after finishing part 1 of the fastai [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSvpQjSnJJ_PmDQB_VyT5iU), I gained a lot of knowledge and insights about the deep learning field and I wanted to have a project to present my new aquired skills. So, I had the idea of implementing a famous deep learning architecture and chose ResNet18 from [He et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) to be my first try at doing so. I used the Oxford-IIIT pets [dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) to make a binary classifier and deployed the model in a hugging face [space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hazemamn/resnet18-Cat-vs-Dog-demo). I hope you like it and I would be delighted to connect and colaborate with you on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hazem-ahmed-mohamed-abdelraouf-4b084a206/).
